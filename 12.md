# Leetcode 14

This is easy idea based question. We use one string as the base, and compare all other words with it. We use an index variable to mark the currently compare position ending.

I would like to mention in this question, divide-and-conquer idea, which is useful in merge K sorted list, does not help. This is because in each subp-roblem, the problem scale does not increase as we combine sub-problems (in fact, the problem scale is decrease in each step). And thus master theorem fails here.

```
// Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
public class Solution {
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
      int len = strs.length;
      if (len <= 0) return "";
      int index = strs[0].length();
      for (int i = 1; i < len; i++){
          index = Math.min(index, strs[i].length());
          for (int j = 0; j < index; j++){
            if (strs[0].charAt(j) != strs[i].charAt(j)){
              index = j; break;
            }
          }
      }
      return strs[0].substring(0, index);
    }
}
